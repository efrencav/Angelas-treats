# Angelas-treats - Capstone Project Proposal
Angelas treats - a cookie website store

Proposal Summary
I want to participate in the Capstone Project by using my recently learned skills and the support from the instructors to build an online store that will allow me to sell cookies.  

The online store will be a functional business website that will allow the sale of cookies, pastries, brownies, and other baked goods. 

The name of the store is called "Angela's treats," and the functionality of the site will allow the user to browse through a menu, select one or several items and will enable the user to place the order. The store should have the functionality of a login or register as a new user.  

I plan to do all research for legalities, competitors, technical resources, project planning, design layout, content development, and other analysis required for the project.
